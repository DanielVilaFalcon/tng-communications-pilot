A list of monitoring metrics should be supported so as to be used by the elasticity policies:


Example:

1. number of users established for wac-vnf (eg. wac_num_endusers)
2. number of sessions established for wac-vnf (eg. wac_num_sessions)
3. bandwidth for ms-vnf (eg. ms_outgoing_traffic)
4. number of ms-vnf worker instances (eg. ms_num_workers) # usefull for safe enforcement of scale in action
5. number of wac-vnf worker instances (eg. wac_num_workers) # usefull for safe enforcement of scale in action
